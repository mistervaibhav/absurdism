<!-- ## What is this?

A React component library that embraces the beautiful chaos of existence. In a world where everything seeks meaning, we create components that celebrate the meaningless—yet somehow become meaningful in their very absurdity. -->

<!-- > _"The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."_ — Albert Camus -->

<!-- ## Philosophy

- **Embrace the void**: Components that work despite their apparent purposelessness
- **Beautiful chaos**: Intentionally bizarre UI patterns that somehow make sense
- **Meaningful meaninglessness**: Code that questions its own existence while being perfectly functional -->

<!-- ## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies (because we must)
npm install

# Run the components (into the abyss)
nx serve components

# Build the library (construct meaning from chaos)
nx build components

# Test (prove nothing, learn everything)
nx test components
``` -->
